    The Chia node and services come with a JSON RPC API server that allows you
    to access information and control the services.  These are accessible via
    HTTPS, WebSockets, or via client SDKs. The ports can be configured in
    `~/.chia/mainnet/config/config.yaml`.  The RPC ports should not be exposed
    to the internet. TLS certificates are used to secure the communication 
    [using mutualTLS](https://github.com/dkackman/chia-api/wiki/Mutual-TLS).

    The daemon uses port 55400 by default.
